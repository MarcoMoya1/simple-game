# simple-game

This is a simple game based off PacMan. The game was created using HTML, CSS, & Javascript. Im following a tutorial video on Youtube to help create the game, but making changes along the way to make the game a version of my own. The game will use local storage to save a players scores and will have a contact section in the footer section of the page.
